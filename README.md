Flask-WTF is an extension that integrates WTForms with Flask for building secure and advanced web forms.

Provides built-in validation, CSRF protection, and easy form handling using Python classes.

Forms are created as Python classes, making them reusable and clean.

Supports advanced fields like PasswordField, SelectField, FileField, TextAreaField, and more.

Built-in validators such as DataRequired, Email, Length, and custom validators improve form reliability.

Automatically handles CSRF tokens for security.

Simplifies rendering forms in templates using form.field.label and form.field().

Ideal for login pages, registration forms, file upload forms, and complex user input handling.
